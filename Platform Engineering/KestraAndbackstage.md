Thousands of plugins for seamless integration with tools like Terraform, GitHub, and AWS.

Minimal coding requirementâ€”only YAML knowledge needed.

### Example: Creating an S3 bucket.

Define workflow metadata (ID, namespace).

Specify inputs for developer-provided values (e.g., bucket name).

Use plugins to automate tasks like S3 bucket creation.

Secrets (e.g., AWS keys) are encoded and managed securely.

Execution logs and analytics help monitor workflow performance.
