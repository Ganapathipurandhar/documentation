project to demonstrate both SOAP and REST involves building two separate web services: one using SOAP and another using REST. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a simple project in Python using the Flask framework for REST and the spyne library for SOAP.
# Project: SOAP and REST Demonstration
### Overview
This project demonstrates how to create:

A SOAP-based web service using the spyne library.

A RESTful web service using the Flask framework.

Both services will perform basic operations like adding two numbers and returning the result.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.

Install the required libraries:
~~~
pip install flask spyne lxml
~~~
### Project Structure
~~~
soap-rest-demo/
│
├── soap_service.py       # SOAP service implementation
├── rest_service.py       # REST service implementation
└── README.md             # Project documentation
~~~

Step 1: SOAP Service Implementation
**soap_service.py**
Step 2: REST Service Implementation
**rest_service.py:**
Step 3: Running the Services
Run the SOAP Service: 
~~~
python soap_service.py
~~~
The SOAP service will start on http://0.0.0.0:8000
1) Run the REST Service:
~~~
python rest_service.py
~~~
he REST service will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

Step 4: Testing the Services
Testing the SOAP Service
You can use a tool like Postman or SOAPUI to test the SOAP service. Alternatively, use the following Python script:**request.py**

Testing the REST Service
You can test the REST service using a browser or curl:
~~~
curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/add?num1=10&num2=20"
~~~

### SOAP and REST Demonstration

This project demonstrates the implementation of both SOAP and REST web services using Python.

## Services
1. **SOAP Service**: Runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. Provides an `add` method to add two numbers.
2. **REST Service**: Runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`. Provides an `/add` endpoint to add two numbers.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask spyne lxml
