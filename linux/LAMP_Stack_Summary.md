## 📖 Introduction

Bradley Knapp from IBM Cloud introduces the concept and components of the LAMP Stack — a foundational open-source framework used to run dynamic websites and web applications.

**LAMP** stands for:
- **L**inux – Operating System  
- **A**pache – Web Server  
- **M**ySQL – Database  
- **P**HP – Programming Language

## 🧱 Components of the LAMP Stack

### Linux (L)
- Free, open-source operating system.
- Forms the base of the LAMP Stack.
- Common distributions: Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, CentOS, Mint.

### Apache (A)
- Web server software from the Apache Foundation.
- Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves appropriate responses.

### MySQL (M)
- Open-source relational database system.
- Stores and manages data like user accounts and form inputs.
- Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations.

### PHP (P)
- Server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web content.
- Connects to MySQL and generates HTML based on application logic.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. A user makes a request from a browser to access a website.
2. Apache receives the request and processes it.
3. PHP runs the backend logic.
4. If necessary, MySQL is queried for dynamic data.
5. Linux manages the system resources and process execution.
6. The server returns the final web content to the user’s browser.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

The LAMP Stack remains one of the most widely adopted and longest-serving software stacks in web development. While newer alternatives exist, LAMP continues to serve as a reliable and efficient solution.
